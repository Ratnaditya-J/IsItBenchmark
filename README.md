# IsItBenchmark 

**Specialized Contamination Detection System for AI Benchmark Datasets**

IsItBenchmark detects when training prompts contain benchmark questions using advanced machine learning techniques. This addresses the critical problem of data contamination in AI evaluation, ensuring fair and accurate model assessment.

## Motivation

### Why I Created IsItBenchmark

As AI models become increasingly powerful, a critical problem has emerged: **benchmark contamination**. Many large language models are inadvertently (or deliberately) trained on benchmark datasets, leading to artificially inflated performance scores that don't reflect true capabilities.

### Research Foundation

This problem is well-documented in academic literature:
- **[[Data Contamination Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04244)]** - Comprehensive analysis of benchmark data contamination in LLMs
- **[[NLP Evaluation Crisis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18018)]** - Position paper on the crisis in NLP evaluation due to contamination
- **[[Data Laundering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15255)]** - Exposes sophisticated benchmark gaming through knowledge distillation
- **[[LiveBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19314)]** - Contamination-resistant benchmark addressing evaluation integrity

**The Problem:**
- **Inflated Scores:** Models appear more capable than they actually are [[GPT-3/4 Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)]
- **Hidden Contamination:** Difficult to detect when models have seen test data
- **Unfair Comparisons:** Contaminated models compete against clean models
- **Research Integrity:** Academic and industry evaluations become unreliable
- **Economic Impact:** Billions invested based on misleading benchmarks
- **Sophisticated Gaming:** Advanced techniques like "data laundering" can bypass detection

**My Solution:**
IsItBenchmark is a specialized system designed specifically to detect benchmark contamination using:
- **Custom-trained models** fine-tuned on 49,159+ benchmark questions
- **Multiple detection techniques** from academic research
